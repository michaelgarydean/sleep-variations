This project draws from a number of other sources that are not included here. They may be added as submodules as I develop this online library. 

For my own memory, Iâ€™ve listed my own sources I drew from here:
- Field Recordings in the Eastern Townships (March 2016)
- Studio Recording Sessions with Saxophonist Brent Clowers (Winter/Spring 2012-2013)
- Fryxellsee Opt - Wiklow live performance at the Goethe Institut (January 2016)

Some credit is also due to others from which I sourced samples.
- Thor Kell - Autoharp sampling sessions at the University of Victoria (2010)
- Jakob Thiessen - MITSUBISHI IMIEV electric car REAR WINDOW WIPERS ext (Sound Effects 2013)
- Jakob Thiessen - walking thru forest 3 (Sound Effects 2013)

Samples or stems over 100mb cannot be uploaded to GitHub -> .gitignore file for specifics.
